# Project Description

Test Task "Online market basket script".
Probably the best thing I was able to do without almost no JavaScript knowledge is to follow this great course on udemy:
"ES6 JavaScript Shopping Cart" - https://www.udemy.com/es6-javascript-shopping-cart/

2+ hours of detailed explanation of shopping cart creation, based on actual version of JS.
This way not really meet the requirements of the task, but better than nothing.
